            Orders outside Dhaka require an advance payment of Tk. 150 or 10% of
            the total amount for large orders. We reserve the right to verify
            payment details before processing orders to prevent fraudulent

            Delivery timelines are estimates and may be subject to delays due to
            unforeseen circumstances such as political unrest, public holidays,
            or supply chain disruptions. If a product is out of stock after an
            order is placed, we reserve the right to cancel the order and issue
            a refund. Orders may take longer to arrive during peak seasons or
            special promotions.

            You may be eligible for a refund or replacement if you receive a
            damaged, defective, or incorrect item. If an incorrect product is
            sent, we will provide the correct item. The customer must return the
            incorrect product in its original condition. Items must be returned
            in their original packaging, unopened, and unused to qualify for a
            refund. Refunds are also applicable if a customer orders a product
            that is later found to be out of stock. Refunds will be processed
            using the original payment method and may take up to 14 working days
            to complete.
