Which makes them more comfortable for more people than any other earbud–style headphones. The speakers inside EarPods have been engineered to maximize sound output and minimize sound loss, which means you get high-quality audio. EarPods with Lightning Connector also include a built-in remote that lets you adjust the volume, control the playback of music and video, and answer or end calls with a pinch of the cord. Works with all devices that have a Lightning connector and support iOS 10 or later, including iPod touch, iPad, and iPhone. Also works with iPad models with iPadOS. A built-in microphone precisely captures your voice while you’re on the phone, taking a FaceTime call, or summoning Siri — so you’re always heard loud and clear.</p>",
