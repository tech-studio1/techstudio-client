    "description": "<p>Awei ES-70TY In-Ear Earphones must correspond because they work hand-in-hand to regulate sound and produce clear acoustics without distortion. The sensitivity is measured by dB SPL/mW. The Bigger dB, The higher the sensitivity rating. A high sensitivity will result in a wide range of power output but may cause some distortion simultaneously. Low sensitivity is harder to damage and not easy distortion, however, it needs your device to have more power output than high sensitivity one. Generally smart phones, tablets, and mp3 players need an earphone from 85dB to 120 dB. &nbsp;It should be noted that at 120 dB, the human ear begins to replace the sensation of hearing with that of pain.&nbsp;Awei ES-70TY price in Bangladesh is 590 TK.
